DISCLAIMER
==========

This submission is supplied without any WARRANTY (EXPRESSED or IMPLIED)
and is intended in good faith to provide the OpenGrok community with a
way to test the functionality of the Razor Repository support, which I
have previously contributed to the OpenGrok project.

THIS REPOSITORY IS IN NO WAY INTENDED FOR ANY RAZOR USER OR
ADMINISTRATOR TO IMPORT OR IN ANY WAY ADD INTO ANY RAZOR SYSTEM. IT IS
PROVIDED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TESTING RAZOR SUPPORT IN OPENGROK.

As stated in the current implementation of Razor Repository support in
OpenGrok, the Razor product is not required to allow the implementation
to function correctly, only read-only access to the file structure of
the repository.

As documented in README-ArchiveCreation, the sample repository has
been cleansed on vendor binaries and other files to reduce the size of
the contribution and so as to not provided any files the vendor
(Visible Systems Corporation) would reasonably consider their property.

The files used to populate the sample Razor repository were extracted
from the sample Mercurial repository (opengrok/testdata/repositories/mercurial)
in the OpenGrok Repository.
