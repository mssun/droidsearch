#
# This file defines which report generation scripts will be attached to
# the issues 'Reports' pulldown menu.  The format of this file is a
# tab-separated list of the label which will appear in the menu, the
# associated shell script to execute and an options field.  The third
# field is optional.
#
# 
#    <label>  <tab>  <script_name>  [<tab> <options>]
# 
# The label may include imbedded spaces since it is separated from the 
# script_name by a tab.  
#
# The field "options" is a comma-separated list which may be any
# combination of the following strings: name, print.  The "name"
# option modifies the method of invocation of the script (refer to 
# the Razor manual, Chapter 9, "Writing report scripts for issues").
# The "print" option directs the resulting report to be automatically
# printed as defined via the user's print command (refer to the
# Razor manual, Chapter 3, "Printing issues").
#
# The special tag SEPARATOR may be used to add a separator between
# report entries.
