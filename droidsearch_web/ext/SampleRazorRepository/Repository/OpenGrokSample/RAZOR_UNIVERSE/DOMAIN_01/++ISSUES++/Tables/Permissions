#
# This file defines who can move files from one state to another
# within the Issues program as well as who if anyone will be notifed
# when such an event occurs.  An '*' in the WHO column means that anyone
# can perform that operation.  The user 'nobody' means nobody can move
# it from the FROM state to the TO state.  To allow all users from a
# specific Unix group to perform a state transition, precede the group 
# name with a plus (+) symbol in the WHO column.  If the Roles file
# has been defined, roles defined there can also be referenced by
# preceding the role name with a % character.  For email, any group
# names contained in the role definition will be ignored.
#
# The FROM and TO defined are all possible combinations STATE pairs.  The
# pattern below should be pretty straight forward to replicate if you are
# using different states than those defined by default.  The states
# defined are directly related to the STATES attribute in the
# Attributes file for the Issues group.
#
#
# NOTE:  The entries in each column are TAB separated.  Groupings of
# user names are comma separated.
#
#
# Below is the line in the Attributes file which defined which
# states we have:
#
# STATES	Submitted, No-Action, Active, Completed, Closed
#
# FROM		--TO--		-WHO-		-EMAIL-
