# 
# Standard Razor data file rules apply.  Empty lines and those beginning
# with a hash ('#') are ignored.  
# 
# All other lines must contain at least three (3) TAB SEPARATED fields.
# If there are fewer than 3 fields, the program errors out.  Some attribute
# types allow/require a 4th TAB SEPARATED field.  The first field denotes
# the type of attribute as follows:
# 
#    CHECK_BOX
#    LABEL       (issues only)
#    ONE_OF_MANY
#    ONE_OF_MANY_LIST
#    ONE_OF_MANY_STACK
#    STATE
#    TEXT_FIELD
#    TEXT_PANE   (issues only)
#    TIME_STAMP  (issues only)
#    X_OF_MANY
#    X_OF_MANY_LIST
# 
# The second field is the label to be associated with the item.  Since
# this is a tab delimited file, it is possible for the label to contain
# embedded spaces, however, we STRONGLY discourage this.  The Razor programs
# will append a colon (':') to the text when displaying it on the screen.
# 
# The third field is required, however, the syntax differs for each of the
# possible attribute types.  Please refer to the manual, Chapter 8,  
# "The Attributes file" for details.
# 
# For ONE_OF_MANY, ONE_OF_MANY_LIST, ONE_OF_MANY_STACK, X_OF_MANY and
# X_OF_MANY_LIST, an optional 4th field defines the number of rows to
# display the attributes.
# 
# The TEXT_PANE attribute is used to label the two scrolling text areas
# at the bottom of the issue form.  The attribute name MUST be of the
# format 'TEXTn' where 'n' is 1 for the first text area, 2 for the second.
# The third field in the TEXT_PANE definition is the string used to
# label the text area.
#
# For TIME_STAMP, the third field is the time format and may be in a
# form as specified in the man pages for strftime.  An example of a time
# format is the string %m/%d/%Y.  This format will display the date in
# the format MM/DD/CCYY.  Please note that conversion characters 
# (i.e. "%m") must be separated by white space or a non-alphanumeric
# character (i.e. "/").
# 
# The fourth field of the TIME_STAMP attribute is a comma-separated list
# of flags of the following format:
# 
#	I=<nn>		-Defines an increment in days to be added to the
#			 current date.
#	P=[Y|N]		-Defines if this field should automatically be
#			 loaded when a new Issue is created.  The default
#			 is N.
#	R=[Y|N]		-Defines if entry of the field is required.  The
#			 default is N.
#	U=[Y|N]		-Defines if the field should automatically be
#			 updated when an Issue is transitioned to the
#			 modify state.  The default is N.
#	W=[Y|N]		-Defines if the field is writable.  The default
#			 is Y.
# 
# NOTE:  For the issues program, the first field MUST be a TEXT_FIELD.
# This text field is shown on the main display as the title for the
# issue.
# 
# CHANGING ATTRIBUTES:  After you have created some issues, you may
# find that you would like to change or add attributes.  To ADD an
# attribute or add a value (including a state) to an existing attribute, 
# take the database server down ("razor down") and edit this file.  
# To RENAME or REMOVE an existing attribute and/or an attribute value
# (including a state), take the database server down and use one of
# the following scripts that may be found in $RAZOR_HOME/scripts:
#
#	rz_rename_attr, rz_rename_attr_val 
#	rz_remove_attr, rz_remove_attr_val
#
# These scripts will update the Attributes file and the existing
# database.  Refer to the manual for details.
