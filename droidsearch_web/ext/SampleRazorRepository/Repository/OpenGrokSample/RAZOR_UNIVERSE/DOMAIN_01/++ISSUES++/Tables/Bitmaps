#	-- THIS FILE IS FOR THE MOTIF VERSION OF RAZOR ONLY --
#
#
# This file contains a list of the bitmaps (glyphs) to use for a specific
# ONE_OF_MANY, ONE_OF_MANY_STACK or STATE attribute on the main 
# scrolling list.  There may be any number of bitmaps shown on each
# line in the main scrolling list which will vary depending on the value
# of a defined attribute.
#
# The format of the file is a tab separated list of attribute label,
# attribute value and fullpath to bitmap in the form:
#
#	<Attr label>  <TAB>  <Attr value>  <TAB>  <fullpath to bitmap>
#
# If no bitmap is defined for a particular value, none will be shown 
# and its place will be left blank.
#
# The ordering of the bitmaps on each line of the main display will be 
# based on the ordering of the
# <Attr label> values.  The first time a new <Attr label> is found in the
# list, a place holder for all possible values is allocated.  Thus
# defining the display order.  Therefore, the first <Attr label> defined
# will have its bitmaps appear in column 1.  The second new <Attr label>
# defined will have all of its bitmaps appear in column 2 and so on.
#
# NOTE:  The '#' symbol is a comment delimiter.
