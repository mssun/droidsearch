# This file defines which field should be made insensitive (grayed out)
# when the attribute/value/who value matches.
#
# The fields are TAB separated and are defined as:
#	ATTRIBUTE	VALUE	WHO	INSENSITIVE
#
# The WHO field can be any combination of users, Unix groups and roles.
# Unix group entries must be preceded by a '+' and role names by a '%'.
# To match users who are not a member of an entry, precede the entry
# with the "not" symbol '!'.
