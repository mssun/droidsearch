# This file defines which commands will be attached to the versions 
# 'Commands' pulldown menu.  Each line contains the label which
# will appear in the menu and the associated command to execute.
# 
#    <label>  <tab>  <command name>
# 
# The label may include embedded spaces since it is separated from the 
# command name by a tab.  
#
# The special <label> SEPARATOR may be used to add a visual separator
# between commands.
