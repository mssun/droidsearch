#
# 
# This file will configure scripts to be run before and after the
# execution of a command in the Versions tool.  The format of this
# file is a tab separated list of button name, script to execute
# before performing the operation, and script to execute after
# performing the operation.  A 'n/a' in a field indicates no script
# should be executed.
# 
# The button names are defined as panel.button.  For example, if you
# want to attach a script to the 'Apply' button on the 'Introduce' 
# popup panel, the button definition would be 'introduce.apply'. 
# 
# Either or both fields may be designated as 'n/a'. 
#
# Also note that the indicated scripts MUST reside on each user's 
# search path.
#
#
# NOTE:  The exit.apply entry only honors the BEFORE
#        script and ignores the AFTER script.
