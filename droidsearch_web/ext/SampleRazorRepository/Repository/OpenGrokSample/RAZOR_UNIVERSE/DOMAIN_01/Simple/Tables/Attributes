#
# This file offers descriptions of the types of attributes that relate
# to files within this 'group'.
#
# Standard RAZOR data file rules apply.  Empty lines and those beginning
# with a hash ('#') are ignored.  These may be sprinkled liberally
# throughout the file.
# 
# All other lines must contain at least three (3) TAB SEPARATED fields.
# If there are fewer than 3 fields, the program errors out.  Some attribute
# types allow/require a 4th TAB SEPARATED field.  The first field denotes
# the type of attribute item, and it must be one of the following...
#
#    CHECK_BOX
#    TEXT_FIELD
#    ONE_OF_MANY
#    ONE_OF_MANY_STACK
#    X_OF_MANY
#    STATE
#    ONE_OF_MANY_LIST
#    X_OF_MANY_LIST
#
# The second field is the label you want associated with the item.  Since
# this is a tab delimited file, it is possible for the label to contain
# embedded spaces, but we strongly discourage this.  The RAZOR programs 
# will append a colon (':') to the text when displaying it on screen.
#
# The third field is required, but the syntax differs for each of the
# possible attribute types.  Please refer to the documentation for
# details.
#
# For ONE_OF_MANY, ONE_OF_MANY_STACK, X_OF_MANY, ONE_OF_MANY_LIST and
# X_OF_MANY_LIST an optional 4th field defines the number of rows to
# display the Attributes.
#
# CHANGING ATTRIBUTES:  After you have placed files under version
# control, you may find that you would like to change or add attributes.  
# To ADD an attribute or add a value (including a state) to an existing  
# attribute, take the database server down ("razor down") and edit this   
# file.  To RENAME or REMOVE an existing attribute and/or an attribute 
# value (including a state), take the database server down and use one 
# of the following scripts that may be found in $RAZOR_HOME/scripts:
#
#	rz_rename_attr, rz_rename_attr_val 
#	rz_remove_attr, rz_remove_attr_val
#
# These scripts will update the Attributes file and the existing
# database.  Refer to the manual for details.
