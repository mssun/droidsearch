#
# This file contains a definition of directories to populate when
# using the 'Generate script' or 'Extract thread' buttons in the Threads
# tool.  
#
# The format mimics a simple case statement.  The case key is based
# on a ONE_OF_MANY attribute label as defined in the Attributes (formerly 
# File_attr_desc) file.  The 'case' statement is then used to define 
# some or all of the possible values of the attribute.  The final 
# entry on the 'case' line is the name of a directory to populate if a 
# file has a match for the specified attribute value.  This
# directory will be appended to the top level directory path defined
# when running the tool.  
#
# Please note that not all values for the attribute must be represented,
# however, a 'default' case must be present.
#
# Please refer to the Razor Users Manual for additional details.

#
# Sample of setting paths based on Filetype.  By default these
# are commented out.
