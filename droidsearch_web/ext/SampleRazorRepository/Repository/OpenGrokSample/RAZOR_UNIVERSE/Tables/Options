# where:
# 	<option> is any of the options listed below
#
#	<setting> is any one of the listed settings
#		  for a given option
#
# All settings are included for each option.  The uncommented
# setting is the default value.
#
#
# The file 'Options' may exist at the universe level
# ($RAZOR_UNIVERSE_DIR/Tables) and/or the group level.  The
# options at the group level have the highest priority.
